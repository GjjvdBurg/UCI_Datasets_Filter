Filter the UCI datasets
=======================

This repository contains a scraper for the UCI datasets, and a python script 
which turns the data into a webpage which allows you to filter the datasets 
easily on the number of instances, number of attributes, etc. I created this 
because I've repeatedly needed to be able to filter on instances/attributes 
and the [UCI dataset page](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) lacks 
this feature.

To view the results go to the GitHub page: [link](link).
